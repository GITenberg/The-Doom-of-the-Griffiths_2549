<h1>THE DOOM OF THE GRIFFITHS.</h1>
<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>
<p>I <span class="smcap">have</span> always been much interested
by the traditions which are scattered up and down North Wales
relating to Owen Glendower (Owain Glendwr is the national
spelling of the name), and I fully enter into the feeling which
makes the Welsh peasant still look upon him as the hero of his
country.&nbsp; There was great joy among many of the inhabitants
of the principality, when the subject of the Welsh prize poem at
Oxford, some fifteen or sixteen years ago, was announced to be
&ldquo;Owain Glendwr.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was the most proudly
national subject that had been given for years.</p>
<p>Perhaps, some may not be aware that this redoubted chieftain
is, even in the present days of enlightenment, as famous among
his illiterate countrymen for his magical powers as for his
patriotism.&nbsp; He says himself&mdash;or Shakespeare says it
for him, which is much the same thing&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;At
my nativity<br />
The front of heaven was full of fiery shapes<br />
Of burning cressets . . .<br />
. . . I can call spirits from the vasty deep.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And few among the lower orders in the principality would think
of asking Hotspur&rsquo;s irreverent question in reply.</p>
<p>Among other traditions preserved relative to this part of the
Welsh hero&rsquo;s character, is the old family prophecy which
gives title to this tale.&nbsp; When Sir David Gam, &ldquo;as
black a traitor as if he had been born in Builth,&rdquo; sought
to murder Owen at Machynlleth, there was one with him whose name
Glendwr little dreamed of having associated with his
enemies.&nbsp; Rhys ap Gryfydd, his &ldquo;old familiar
friend,&rdquo; his relation, his more than brother, had consented
unto his blood.&nbsp; Sir David Gam might be forgiven, but one
whom he had loved, and who had betrayed him, could never be
forgiven.&nbsp; Glendwr was too deeply read in the human heart to
kill him.&nbsp; No, he let him live on, the loathing and scorn of
his compatriots, and the victim of bitter remorse.&nbsp; The mark
of Cain was upon him.</p>
<p>But before he went forth&mdash;while he yet stood a prisoner,
cowering beneath his conscience before Owain Glendwr&mdash;that
chieftain passed a doom upon him and his race:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I doom thee to live, because I know thou wilt pray for
death.&nbsp; Thou shalt live on beyond the natural term of the
life of man, the scorn of all good men.&nbsp; The very children
shall point to thee with hissing tongue, and say, &lsquo;There
goes one who would have shed a brother&rsquo;s
blood!&rsquo;&nbsp; For I loved thee more than a brother, oh Rhys
ap Gryfydd!&nbsp; Thou shalt live on to see all of thy house,
except the weakling in arms, perish by the sword.&nbsp; Thy race
shall be accursed.&nbsp; Each generation shall see their lands
melt away like snow; yea their wealth shall vanish, though they
may labour night and day to heap up gold.&nbsp; And when nine
generations have passed from the face of the earth, thy blood
shall no longer flow in the veins of any human being.&nbsp; In
those days the last male of thy race shall avenge me.&nbsp; The
son shall slay the father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such was the traditionary account of Owain Glendwr&rsquo;s
speech to his once-trusted friend.&nbsp; And it was declared that
the doom had been fulfilled in all things; that live in as
miserly a manner as they would, the Griffiths never were wealthy
and prosperous&mdash;indeed that their worldly stock diminished
without any visible cause.</p>
<p>But the lapse of many years had almost deadened the
wonder-inspiring power of the whole curse.&nbsp; It was only
brought forth from the hoards of Memory when some untoward event
happened to the Griffiths family; and in the eighth generation
the faith in the prophecy was nearly destroyed, by the marriage
of the Griffiths of that day, to a Miss Owen, who, unexpectedly,
by the death of a brother, became an heiress&mdash;to no
considerable amount, to be sure, but enough to make the prophecy
appear reversed.&nbsp; The heiress and her husband removed from
his small patrimonial estate in Merionethshire, to her heritage
in Caernarvonshire, and for a time the prophecy lay dormant.</p>
<p>If you go from Tremadoc to Criccaeth, you pass by the
parochial church of Ynysynhanarn, situated in a boggy valley
running from the mountains, which shoulder up to the Rivals, down
to Cardigan Bay.&nbsp; This tract of land has every appearance of
having been redeemed at no distant period of time from the sea,
and has all the desolate rankness often attendant upon such
marshes.&nbsp; But the valley beyond, similar in character, had
yet more of gloom at the time of which I write.&nbsp; In the
higher part there were large plantations of firs, set too closely
to attain any size, and remaining stunted in height and scrubby
in appearance.&nbsp; Indeed, many of the smaller and more weakly
had died, and the bark had fallen down on the brown soil
neglected and unnoticed.&nbsp; These trees had a ghastly
appearance, with their white trunks, seen by the dim light which
struggled through the thick boughs above.&nbsp; Nearer to the
sea, the valley assumed a more open, though hardly a more
cheerful character; it looked dark and overhung by sea-fog
through the greater part of the year, and even a farm-house,
which usually imparts something of cheerfulness to a landscape,
failed to do so here.&nbsp; This valley formed the greater part
of the estate to which Owen Griffiths became entitled by right of
his wife.&nbsp; In the higher part of the valley was situated the
family mansion, or rather dwelling-house, for
&ldquo;mansion&rdquo; is too grand a word to apply to the clumsy,
but substantially-built Bodowen.&nbsp; It was square and
heavy-looking, with just that much pretension to ornament
necessary to distinguish it from the mere farm-house.</p>
<p>In this dwelling Mrs. Owen Griffiths bore her husband two
sons&mdash;Llewellyn, the future Squire, and Robert, who was
early destined for the Church.&nbsp; The only difference in their
situation, up to the time when Robert was entered at Jesus
College, was, that the elder was invariably indulged by all
around him, while Robert was thwarted and indulged by turns; that
Llewellyn never learned anything from the poor Welsh parson, who
was nominally his private tutor; while occasionally Squire
Griffiths made a great point of enforcing Robert&rsquo;s
diligence, telling him that, as he had his bread to earn, he must
pay attention to his learning.&nbsp; There is no knowing how far
the very irregular education he had received would have carried
Robert through his college examinations; but, luckily for him in
this respect, before such a trial of his learning came round, he
heard of the death of his elder brother, after a short illness,
brought on by a hard drinking-bout.&nbsp; Of course, Robert was
summoned home, and it seemed quite as much of course, now that
there was no necessity for him to &ldquo;earn his bread by his
learning,&rdquo; that he should not return to Oxford.&nbsp; So
the half-educated, but not unintelligent, young man continued at
home, during the short remainder of his parent&rsquo;s
lifetime.</p>
<p>His was not an uncommon character.&nbsp; In general he was
mild, indolent, and easily managed; but once thoroughly roused,
his passions were vehement and fearful.&nbsp; He seemed, indeed,
almost afraid of himself, and in common hardly dared to give way
to justifiable anger&mdash;so much did he dread losing his
self-control.&nbsp; Had he been judiciously educated, he would,
probably, have distinguished himself in those branches of
literature which call for taste and imagination, rather than any
exertion of reflection or judgment.&nbsp; As it was, his literary
taste showed itself in making collections of Cambrian antiquities
of every description, till his stock of Welsh MSS. would have
excited the envy of Dr. Pugh himself, had he been alive at the
time of which I write.</p>
<p>There is one characteristic of Robert Griffiths which I have
omitted to note, and which was peculiar among his class.&nbsp; He
was no hard drinker; whether it was that his head was easily
affected, or that his partially-refined taste led him to dislike
intoxication and its attendant circumstances, I cannot say; but
at five-and-twenty Robert Griffiths was habitually sober&mdash;a
thing so rare in Llyn, that he was almost shunned as a churlish,
unsociable being, and paused much of his time in solitude.</p>
<p>About this time, he had to appear in some case that was tried
at the Caernarvon assizes; and while there, was a guest at the
house of his agent, a shrewd, sensible Welsh attorney, with one
daughter, who had charms enough to captivate Robert
Griffiths.&nbsp; Though he remained only a few days at her
father&rsquo;s house, they were sufficient to decide his
affections, and short was the period allowed to elapse before he
brought home a mistress to Bodowen.&nbsp; The new Mrs. Griffiths
was a gentle, yielding person, full of love toward her husband,
of whom, nevertheless, she stood something in awe, partly arising
from the difference in their ages, partly from his devoting much
time to studies of which she could understand nothing.</p>
<p>She soon made him the father of a blooming little daughter,
called Augharad after her mother.&nbsp; Then there came several
uneventful years in the household of Bodowen; and when the old
women had one and all declared that the cradle would not rock
again, Mrs. Griffiths bore the son and heir.&nbsp; His birth was
soon followed by his mother&rsquo;s death: she had been ailing
and low-spirited during her pregnancy, and she seemed to lack the
buoyancy of body and mind requisite to bring her round after her
time of trial.&nbsp; Her husband, who loved her all the more from
having few other claims on his affections, was deeply grieved by
her early death, and his only comforter was the sweet little boy
whom she had left behind.&nbsp; That part of the squire&rsquo;s
character, which was so tender, and almost feminine, seemed
called forth by the helpless situation of the little infant, who
stretched out his arms to his father with the same earnest cooing
that happier children make use of to their mother alone.&nbsp;
Augharad was almost neglected, while the little Owen was king of
the house; still next to his father, none tended him so lovingly
as his sister.&nbsp; She was so accustomed to give way to him
that it was no longer a hardship.&nbsp; By night and by day Owen
was the constant companion of his father, and increasing years
seemed only to confirm the custom.&nbsp; It was an unnatural life
for the child, seeing no bright little faces peering into his own
(for Augharad was, as I said before, five or six years older, and
her face, poor motherless girl! was often anything but bright),
hearing no din of clear ringing voices, but day after day sharing
the otherwise solitary hours of his father, whether in the dim
room, surrounded by wizard-like antiquities, or pattering his
little feet to keep up with his &ldquo;tada&rdquo; in his
mountain rambles or shooting excursions.&nbsp; When the pair came
to some little foaming brook, where the stepping-stones were far
and wide, the father carried his little boy across with the
tenderest care; when the lad was weary, they rested, he cradled
in his father&rsquo;s arms, or the Squire would lift him up and
carry him to his home again.&nbsp; The boy was indulged (for his
father felt flattered by the desire) in his wish of sharing his
meals and keeping the same hours.&nbsp; All this indulgence did
not render Owen unamiable, but it made him wilful, and not a
happy child.&nbsp; He had a thoughtful look, not common to the
face of a young boy.&nbsp; He knew no games, no merry sports; his
information was of an imaginative and speculative
character.&nbsp; His father delighted to interest him in his own
studies, without considering how far they were healthy for so
young a mind.</p>
<p>Of course Squire Griffiths was not unaware of the prophecy
which was to be fulfilled in his generation.&nbsp; He would
occasionally refer to it when among his friends, with sceptical
levity; but in truth it lay nearer to his heart than he chose to
acknowledge.&nbsp; His strong imagination rendered him peculiarly
impressible on such subjects; while his judgment, seldom
exercised or fortified by severe thought, could not prevent his
continually recurring to it.&nbsp; He used to gaze on the
half-sad countenance of the child, who sat looking up into his
face with his large dark eyes, so fondly yet so inquiringly, till
the old legend swelled around his heart, and became too painful
for him not to require sympathy.&nbsp; Besides, the overpowering
love he bore to the child seemed to demand fuller vent than
tender words; it made him like, yet dread, to upbraid its object
for the fearful contrast foretold.&nbsp; Still Squire Griffiths
told the legend, in a half-jesting manner, to his little son,
when they were roaming over the wild heaths in the autumn days,
&ldquo;the saddest of the year,&rdquo; or while they sat in the
oak-wainscoted room, surrounded by mysterious relics that gleamed
strangely forth by the flickering fire-light.&nbsp; The legend
was wrought into the boy&rsquo;s mind, and he would crave, yet
tremble, to hear it told over and over again, while the words
were intermingled with caresses and questions as to his
love.&nbsp; Occasionally his loving words and actions were cut
short by his father&rsquo;s light yet bitter
speech&mdash;&ldquo;Get thee away, my lad; thou knowest not what
is to come of all this love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Augharad was seventeen, and Owen eleven or twelve, the
rector of the parish in which Bodowen was situated, endeavoured
to prevail on Squire Griffiths to send the boy to school.&nbsp;
Now, this rector had many congenial tastes with his parishioner,
and was his only intimate; and, by repeated arguments, he
succeeded in convincing the Squire that the unnatural life Owen
was leading was in every way injurious.&nbsp; Unwillingly was the
father wrought to part from his son; but he did at length send
him to the Grammar School at Bangor, then under the management of
an excellent classic.&nbsp; Here Owen showed that he had more
talents than the rector had given him credit for, when he
affirmed that the lad had been completely stupefied by the life
he led at Bodowen.&nbsp; He bade fair to do credit to the school
in the peculiar branch of learning for which it was famous.&nbsp;
But he was not popular among his schoolfellows.&nbsp; He was
wayward, though, to a certain degree, generous and unselfish; he
was reserved but gentle, except when the tremendous bursts of
passion (similar in character to those of his father) forced
their way.</p>
<p>On his return from school one Christmas-time, when he had been
a year or so at Bangor, he was stunned by hearing that the
undervalued Augharad was about to be married to a gentleman of
South Wales, residing near Aberystwith.&nbsp; Boys seldom
appreciate their sisters; but Owen thought of the many slights
with which he had requited the patient Augharad, and he gave way
to bitter regrets, which, with a selfish want of control over his
words, he kept expressing to his father, until the Squire was
thoroughly hurt and chagrined at the repeated exclamations of
&ldquo;What shall we do when Augharad is gone?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;How dull we shall be when Augharad is
married!&rdquo;&nbsp; Owen&rsquo;s holidays were prolonged a few
weeks, in order that he might be present at the wedding; and when
all the festivities were over, and the bride and bridegroom had
left Bodowen, the boy and his father really felt how much they
missed the quiet, loving Augharad.&nbsp; She had performed so
many thoughtful, noiseless little offices, on which their daily
comfort depended; and now she was gone, the household seemed to
miss the spirit that peacefully kept it in order; the servants
roamed about in search of commands and directions, the rooms had
no longer the unobtrusive ordering of taste to make them
cheerful, the very fires burned dim, and were always sinking down
into dull heaps of gray ashes.&nbsp; Altogether Owen did not
regret his return to Bangor, and this also the mortified parent
perceived.&nbsp; Squire Griffiths was a selfish parent.</p>
<p>Letters in those days were a rare occurrence.&nbsp; Owen
usually received one during his half-yearly absences from home,
and occasionally his father paid him a visit.&nbsp; This
half-year the boy had no visit, nor even a letter, till very near
the time of his leaving school, and then he was astounded by the
intelligence that his father was married again.</p>
<p>Then came one of his paroxysms of rage; the more disastrous in
its effects upon his character because it could find no vent in
action.&nbsp; Independently of slight to the memory of the first
wife which children are so apt to fancy such an action implies,
Owen had hitherto considered himself (and with justice) the first
object of his father&rsquo;s life.&nbsp; They had been so much to
each other; and now a shapeless, but too real something had come
between him and his father there for ever.&nbsp; He felt as if
his permission should have been asked, as if he should have been
consulted.&nbsp; Certainly he ought to have been told of the
intended event.&nbsp; So the Squire felt, and hence his
constrained letter which had so much increased the bitterness of
Owen&rsquo;s feelings.</p>
<p>With all this anger, when Owen saw his stepmother, he thought
he had never seen so beautiful a woman for her age; for she was
no longer in the bloom of youth, being a widow when his father
married her.&nbsp; Her manners, to the Welsh lad, who had seen
little of female grace among the families of the few antiquarians
with whom his father visited, were so fascinating that he watched
her with a sort of breathless admiration.&nbsp; Her measured
grace, her faultless movements, her tones of voice, sweet, till
the ear was sated with their sweetness, made Owen less angry at
his father&rsquo;s marriage.&nbsp; Yet he felt, more than ever,
that the cloud was between him and his father; that the hasty
letter he had sent in answer to the announcement of his wedding
was not forgotten, although no allusion was ever made to
it.&nbsp; He was no longer his father&rsquo;s
confidant&mdash;hardly ever his father&rsquo;s companion, for the
newly-married wife was all in all to the Squire, and his son felt
himself almost a cipher, where he had so long been
everything.&nbsp; The lady herself had ever the softest
consideration for her stepson; almost too obtrusive was the
attention paid to his wishes, but still he fancied that the heart
had no part in the winning advances.&nbsp; There was a watchful
glance of the eye that Owen once or twice caught when she had
imagined herself unobserved, and many other nameless little
circumstances, that gave him a strong feeling of want of
sincerity in his stepmother.&nbsp; Mrs. Owen brought with her
into the family her little child by her first husband, a boy
nearly three years old.&nbsp; He was one of those elfish,
observant, mocking children, over whose feelings you seem to have
no control: agile and mischievous, his little practical jokes, at
first performed in ignorance of the pain he gave, but afterward
proceeding to a malicious pleasure in suffering, really seemed to
afford some ground to the superstitious notion of some of the
common people that he was a fairy changeling.</p>
<p>Years passed on; and as Owen grew older he became more
observant.&nbsp; He saw, even in his occasional visits at home
(for from school he had passed on to college), that a great
change had taken place in the outward manifestations of his
father&rsquo;s character; and, by degrees, Owen traced this
change to the influence of his stepmother; so slight, so
imperceptible to the common observer, yet so resistless in its
effects.&nbsp; Squire Griffiths caught up his wife&rsquo;s humbly
advanced opinions, and, unawares to himself, adopted them as his
own, defying all argument and opposition.&nbsp; It was the same
with her wishes; they met their fulfilment, from the extreme and
delicate art with which she insinuated them into her
husband&rsquo;s mind, as his own.&nbsp; She sacrificed the show
of authority for the power.&nbsp; At last, when Owen perceived
some oppressive act in his father&rsquo;s conduct toward his
dependants, or some unaccountable thwarting of his own wishes, he
fancied he saw his stepmother&rsquo;s secret influence thus
displayed, however much she might regret the injustice of his
father&rsquo;s actions in her conversations with him when they
were alone.&nbsp; His father was fast losing his temperate
habits, and frequent intoxication soon took its usual effect upon
the temper.&nbsp; Yet even here was the spell of his wife upon
him.&nbsp; Before her he placed a restraint upon his passion, yet
she was perfectly aware of his irritable disposition, and
directed it hither and thither with the same apparent ignorance
of the tendency of her words.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Owen&rsquo;s situation became peculiarly mortifying
to a youth whose early remembrances afforded such a contrast to
his present state.&nbsp; As a child, he had been elevated to the
consequence of a man before his years gave any mental check to
the selfishness which such conduct was likely to engender; he
could remember when his will was law to the servants and
dependants, and his sympathy necessary to his father: now he was
as a cipher in his father&rsquo;s house; and the Squire,
estranged in the first instance by a feeling of the injury he had
done his son in not sooner acquainting him with his purposed
marriage, seemed rather to avoid than to seek him as a companion,
and too frequently showed the most utter indifference to the
feelings and wishes which a young man of a high and independent
spirit might be supposed to indulge.</p>
<p>Perhaps Owen was not fully aware of the force of all these
circumstances; for an actor in a family drama is seldom
unimpassioned enough to be perfectly observant.&nbsp; But he
became moody and soured; brooding over his unloved existence, and
craving with a human heart after sympathy.</p>
<p>This feeling took more full possession of his mind when he had
left college, and returned home to lead an idle and purposeless
life.&nbsp; As the heir, there was no worldly necessity for
exertion: his father was too much of a Welsh squire to dream of
the moral necessity, and he himself had not sufficient strength
of mind to decide at once upon abandoning a place and mode of
life which abounded in daily mortifications; yet to this course
his judgment was slowly tending, when some circumstances occurred
to detain him at Bodowen.</p>
<p>It was not to be expected that harmony would long be
preserved, even in appearance, between an unguarded and soured
young man, such as Owen, and his wary stepmother, when he had
once left college, and come, not as a visitor, but as the heir to
his father&rsquo;s house.&nbsp; Some cause of difference
occurred, where the woman subdued her hidden anger sufficiently
to become convinced that Owen was not entirely the dupe she had
believed him to be.&nbsp; Henceforward there was no peace between
them.&nbsp; Not in vulgar altercations did this show itself; but
in moody reserve on Owen&rsquo;s part, and in undisguised and
contemptuous pursuance of her own plans by his stepmother.&nbsp;
Bodowen was no longer a place where, if Owen was not loved or
attended to, he could at least find peace, and care for himself:
he was thwarted at every step, and in every wish, by his
father&rsquo;s desire, apparently, while the wife sat by with a
smile of triumph on her beautiful lips.</p>
<p>So Owen went forth at the early day dawn, sometimes roaming
about on the shore or the upland, shooting or fishing, as the
season might be, but oftener &ldquo;stretched in indolent
repose&rdquo; on the short, sweet grass, indulging in gloomy and
morbid reveries.&nbsp; He would fancy that this mortified state
of existence was a dream, a horrible dream, from which he should
awake and find himself again the sole object and darling of his
father.&nbsp; And then he would start up and strive to shake off
the incubus.&nbsp; There was the molten sunset of his childish
memory; the gorgeous crimson piles of glory in the west, fading
away into the cold calm light of the rising moon, while here and
there a cloud floated across the western heaven, like a
seraph&rsquo;s wing, in its flaming beauty; the earth was the
same as in his childhood&rsquo;s days, full of gentle evening
sounds, and the harmonies of twilight&mdash;the breeze came
sweeping low over the heather and blue-bells by his side, and the
turf was sending up its evening incense of perfume.&nbsp; But
life, and heart, and hope were changed for ever since those
bygone days!</p>
<p>Or he would seat himself in a favourite niche of the rocks on
Moel G&ecirc;st, hidden by a stunted growth of the whitty, or
mountain-ash, from general observation, with a rich-tinted
cushion of stone-crop for his feet, and a straight precipice of
rock rising just above.&nbsp; Here would he sit for hours, gazing
idly at the bay below with its back-ground of purple hills, and
the little fishing-sail on its bosom, showing white in the
sunbeam, and gliding on in such harmony with the quiet beauty of
the glassy sea; or he would pull out an old school-volume, his
companion for years, and in morbid accordance with the dark
legend that still lurked in the recesses of his mind&mdash;a
shape of gloom in those innermost haunts awaiting its time to
come forth in distinct outline&mdash;would he turn to the old
Greek dramas which treat of a family foredoomed by an avenging
Fate.&nbsp; The worn page opened of itself at the play of the
&OElig;dipus Tyrannus, and Owen dwelt with the craving disease
upon the prophecy so nearly resembling that which concerned
himself.&nbsp; With his consciousness of neglect, there was a
sort of self-flattery in the consequence which the legend gave
him.&nbsp; He almost wondered how they durst, with slights and
insults, thus provoke the Avenger.</p>
<p>The days drifted onward.&nbsp; Often he would vehemently
pursue some sylvan sport, till thought and feeling were lost in
the violence of bodily exertion.&nbsp; Occasionally his evenings
were spent at a small public-house, such as stood by the
unfrequented wayside, where the welcome, hearty, though bought,
seemed so strongly to contrast with the gloomy negligence of
home&mdash;unsympathising home.</p>
<p>One evening (Owen might be four or five-and-twenty), wearied
with a day&rsquo;s shooting on the Clenneny Moors, he passed by
the open door of &ldquo;The Goat&rdquo; at Penmorfa.&nbsp; The
light and the cheeriness within tempted him, poor self-exhausted
man! as it has done many a one more wretched in worldly
circumstances, to step in, and take his evening meal where at
least his presence was of some consequence.&nbsp; It was a busy
day in that little hostel.&nbsp; A flock of sheep, amounting to
some hundreds, had arrived at Penmorfa, on their road to England,
and thronged the space before the house.&nbsp; Inside was the
shrewd, kind-hearted hostess, bustling to and fro, with merry
greetings for every tired drover who was to pass the night in her
house, while the sheep were penned in a field close by.&nbsp;
Ever and anon, she kept attending to the second crowd of guests,
who were celebrating a rural wedding in her house.&nbsp; It was
busy work to Martha Thomas, yet her smile never flagged; and when
Owen Griffiths had finished his evening meal she was there, ready
with a hope that it had done him good, and was to his mind, and a
word of intelligence that the wedding-folk were about to dance in
the kitchen, and the harper was the famous Edward of Corwen.</p>
<p>Owen, partly from good-natured compliance with his
hostess&rsquo;s implied wish, and partly from curiosity, lounged
to the passage which led to the kitchen&mdash;not the every-day,
working, cooking kitchen, which was behind, but a good-sized
room, where the mistress sat, when her work was done, and where
the country people were commonly entertained at such
merry-makings as the present.&nbsp; The lintels of the door
formed a frame for the animated picture which Owen saw within, as
he leaned against the wall in the dark passage.&nbsp; The red
light of the fire, with every now and then a falling piece of
turf sending forth a fresh blaze, shone full upon four young men
who were dancing a measure something like a Scotch reel, keeping
admirable time in their rapid movements to the capital tune the
harper was playing.&nbsp; They had their hats on when Owen first
took his stand, but as they grew more and more animated they
flung them away, and presently their shoes were kicked off with
like disregard to the spot where they might happen to
alight.&nbsp; Shouts of applause followed any remarkable exertion
of agility, in which each seemed to try to excel his
companions.&nbsp; At length, wearied and exhausted, they sat
down, and the harper gradually changed to one of those wild,
inspiring national airs for which he was so famous.&nbsp; The
thronged audience sat earnest and breathless, and you might have
heard a pin drop, except when some maiden passed hurriedly, with
flaring candle and busy look, through to the real kitchen
beyond.&nbsp; When he had finished his beautiful theme on
&ldquo;The March of the men of Harlech,&rdquo; he changed the
measure again to &ldquo;Tri chant o&rsquo; bunnan&rdquo; (Three
hundred pounds), and immediately a most unmusical-looking man
began chanting &ldquo;Pennillion,&rdquo; or a sort of recitative
stanzas, which were soon taken up by another, and this amusement
lasted so long that Owen grew weary, and was thinking of
retreating from his post by the door, when some little bustle was
occasioned, on the opposite side of the room, by the entrance of
a middle-aged man, and a young girl, apparently his
daughter.&nbsp; The man advanced to the bench occupied by the
seniors of the party, who welcomed him with the usual pretty
Welsh greeting, &ldquo;Pa sut mae dy galon?&rdquo; (&ldquo;How is
thy heart?&rdquo;) and drinking his health passed on to him the
cup of excellent <i>cwrw</i>.&nbsp; The girl, evidently a village
belle, was as warmly greeted by the young men, while the girls
eyed her rather askance with a half-jealous look, which Owen set
down to the score of her extreme prettiness.&nbsp; Like most
Welsh women, she was of middle size as to height, but beautifully
made, with the most perfect yet delicate roundness in every
limb.&nbsp; Her little mob-cap was carefully adjusted to a face
which was excessively pretty, though it never could be called
handsome.&nbsp; It also was round, with the slightest tendency to
the oval shape, richly coloured, though somewhat olive in
complexion, with dimples in cheek and chin, and the most scarlet
lips Owen had ever seen, that were too short to meet over the
small pearly teeth.&nbsp; The nose was the most defective
feature; but the eyes were splendid.&nbsp; They were so long, so
lustrous, yet at times so very soft under their thick fringe of
eyelash!&nbsp; The nut-brown hair was carefully braided beneath
the border of delicate lace: it was evident the little village
beauty knew how to make the most of all her attractions, for the
gay colours which were displayed in her neckerchief were in
complete harmony with the complexion.</p>
<p>Owen was much attracted, while yet he was amused, by the
evident coquetry the girl displayed, collecting around her a
whole bevy of young fellows, for each of whom she seemed to have
some gay speech, some attractive look or action.&nbsp; In a few
minutes young Griffiths of Bodowen was at her side, brought
thither by a variety of idle motives, and as her undivided
attention was given to the Welsh heir, her admirers, one by one,
dropped off, to seat themselves by some less fascinating but more
attentive fair one.&nbsp; The more Owen conversed with the girl,
the more he was taken; she had more wit and talent than he had
fancied possible; a self-abandon and thoughtfulness, to boot,
that seemed full of charms; and then her voice was so clear and
sweet, and her actions so full of grace, that Owen was fascinated
before he was well aware, and kept looking into her bright,
blushing face, till her uplifted flashing eye fell beneath his
earnest gaze.</p>
<p>While it thus happened that they were silent&mdash;she from
confusion at the unexpected warmth of his admiration, he from an
unconsciousness of anything but the beautiful changes in her
flexile countenance&mdash;the man whom Owen took for her father
came up and addressed some observation to his daughter, from
whence he glided into some commonplace though respectful remark
to Owen, and at length engaging him in some slight, local
conversation, he led the way to the account of a spot on the
peninsula of Penthryn, where teal abounded, and concluded with
begging Owen to allow him to show him the exact place, saying
that whenever the young Squire felt so inclined, if he would
honour him by a call at his house, he would take him across in
his boat.&nbsp; While Owen listened, his attention was not so
much absorbed as to be unaware that the little beauty at his side
was refusing one or two who endeavoured to draw her from her
place by invitations to dance.&nbsp; Flattered by his own
construction of her refusals, he again directed all his attention
to her, till she was called away by her father, who was leaving
the scene of festivity.&nbsp; Before he left he reminded Owen of
his promise, and added&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps, sir, you do not know me.&nbsp; My name is
Ellis Pritchard, and I live at Ty Glas, on this side of Moel
G&ecirc;st; anyone can point it out to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the father and daughter had left, Owen slowly prepared
for his ride home; but encountering the hostess, he could not
resist asking a few questions relative to Ellis Pritchard and his
pretty daughter.&nbsp; She answered shortly but respectfully, and
then said, rather hesitatingly&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Master Griffiths, you know the triad, &lsquo;Tri pheth
tebyg y naill i&rsquo;r llall, ysgnbwr heb yd, mail deg heb
ddiawd, a merch deg heb ei geirda&rsquo; (Three things are alike:
a fine barn without corn, a fine cup without drink, a fine woman
without her reputation).&rdquo;&nbsp; She hastily quitted him,
and Owen rode slowly to his unhappy home.</p>
<p>Ellis Pritchard, half farmer and half fisherman, was shrewd,
and keen, and worldly; yet he was good-natured, and sufficiently
generous to have become rather a popular man among his
equals.&nbsp; He had been struck with the young Squire&rsquo;s
attention to his pretty daughter, and was not insensible to the
advantages to be derived from it.&nbsp; Nest would not be the
first peasant girl, by any means, who had been transplanted to a
Welsh manor-house as its mistress; and, accordingly, her father
had shrewdly given the admiring young man some pretext for
further opportunities of seeing her.</p>
<p>As for Nest herself, she had somewhat of her father&rsquo;s
worldliness, and was fully alive to the superior station of her
new admirer, and quite prepared to slight all her old sweethearts
on his account.&nbsp; But then she had something more of feeling
in her reckoning; she had not been insensible to the earnest yet
comparatively refined homage which Owen paid her; she had noticed
his expressive and occasionally handsome countenance with
admiration, and was flattered by his so immediately singling her
out from her companions.&nbsp; As to the hint which Martha Thomas
had thrown out, it is enough to say that Nest was very giddy, and
that she was motherless.&nbsp; She had high spirits and a great
love of admiration, or, to use a softer term, she loved to
please; men, women, and children, all, she delighted to gladden
with her smile and voice.&nbsp; She coquetted, and flirted, and
went to the extreme lengths of Welsh courtship, till the seniors
of the village shook their heads, and cautioned their daughters
against her acquaintance.&nbsp; If not absolutely guilty, she had
too frequently been on the verge of guilt.</p>
<p>Even at the time, Martha Thomas&rsquo;s hint made but little
impression on Owen, for his senses were otherwise occupied; but
in a few days the recollection thereof had wholly died away, and
one warm glorious summer&rsquo;s day, he bent his steps toward
Ellis Pritchard&rsquo;s with a beating heart; for, except some
very slight flirtations at Oxford, Owen had never been touched;
his thoughts, his fancy, had been otherwise engaged.</p>
<p>Ty Glas was built against one of the lower rocks of Moel
G&ecirc;st, which, indeed, formed a side to the low, lengthy
house.&nbsp; The materials of the cottage were the shingly stones
which had fallen from above, plastered rudely together, with deep
recesses for the small oblong windows.&nbsp; Altogether, the
exterior was much ruder than Owen had expected; but inside there
seemed no lack of comforts.&nbsp; The house was divided into two
apartments, one large, roomy, and dark, into which Owen entered
immediately; and before the blushing Nest came from the inner
chamber (for she had seen the young Squire coming, and hastily
gone to make some alteration in her dress), he had had time to
look around him, and note the various little particulars of the
room.&nbsp; Beneath the window (which commanded a magnificent
view) was an oaken dresser, replete with drawers and cupboards,
and brightly polished to a rich dark colour.&nbsp; In the farther
part of the room Owen could at first distinguish little, entering
as he did from the glaring sunlight, but he soon saw that there
were two oaken beds, closed up after the manner of the Welsh: in
fact, the domitories of Ellis Pritchard and the man who served
under him, both on sea and on land.&nbsp; There was the large
wheel used for spinning wool, left standing on the middle of the
floor, as if in use only a few minutes before; and around the
ample chimney hung flitches of bacon, dried kids&rsquo;-flesh,
and fish, that was in process of smoking for winter&rsquo;s
store.</p>
<p>Before Nest had shyly dared to enter, her father, who had been
mending his nets down below, and seen Owen winding up to the
house, came in and gave him a hearty yet respectful welcome; and
then Nest, downcast and blushing, full of the consciousness which
her father&rsquo;s advice and conversation had not failed to
inspire, ventured to join them.&nbsp; To Owen&rsquo;s mind this
reserve and shyness gave her new charms.</p>
<p>It was too bright, too hot, too anything to think of going to
shoot teal till later in the day, and Owen was delighted to
accept a hesitating invitation to share the noonday meal.&nbsp;
Some ewe-milk cheese, very hard and dry, oat-cake, slips of the
dried kids&rsquo;-flesh broiled, after having been previously
soaked in water for a few minutes, delicious butter and fresh
butter-milk, with a liquor called &ldquo;diod griafol&rdquo;
(made from the berries of the <i>Sorbus aucuparia</i>, infused in
water and then fermented), composed the frugal repast; but there
was something so clean and neat, and withal such a true welcome,
that Owen had seldom enjoyed a meal so much.&nbsp; Indeed, at
that time of day the Welsh squires differed from the farmers more
in the plenty and rough abundance of their manner of living than
in the refinement of style of their table.</p>
<p>At the present day, down in Llyn, the Welsh gentry are not a
wit behind their Saxon equals in the expensive elegances of life;
but then (when there was but one pewter-service in all
Northumberland) there was nothing in Ellis Pritchard&rsquo;s mode
of living that grated on the young Squire&rsquo;s sense of
refinement.</p>
<p>Little was said by that young pair of wooers during the meal;
the father had all the conversation to himself, apparently
heedless of the ardent looks and inattentive mien of his
guest.&nbsp; As Owen became more serious in his feelings, he grew
more timid in their expression, and at night, when they returned
from their shooting-excursion, the caress he gave Nest was almost
as bashfully offered as received.</p>
<p>This was but the first of a series of days devoted to Nest in
reality, though at first he thought some little disguise of his
object was necessary.&nbsp; The past, the future, was all
forgotten in those happy days of love.</p>
<p>And every worldly plan, every womanly wile was put in practice
by Ellis Pritchard and his daughter, to render his visits
agreeable and alluring.&nbsp; Indeed, the very circumstance of
his being welcome was enough to attract the poor young man, to
whom the feeling so produced was new and full of charms.&nbsp; He
left a home where the certainty of being thwarted made him chary
in expressing his wishes; where no tones of love ever fell on his
ear, save those addressed to others; where his presence or
absence was a matter of utter indifference; and when he entered
Ty Glas, all, down to the little cur which, with clamorous
barkings, claimed a part of his attention, seemed to
rejoice.&nbsp; His account of his day&rsquo;s employment found a
willing listener in Ellis; and when he passed on to Nest, busy at
her wheel or at her churn, the deepened colour, the conscious
eye, and the gradual yielding of herself up to his lover-like
caress, had worlds of charms.&nbsp; Ellis Pritchard was a tenant
on the Bodowen estate, and therefore had reasons in plenty for
wishing to keep the young Squire&rsquo;s visits secret; and Owen,
unwilling to disturb the sunny calm of these halcyon days by any
storm at home, was ready to use all the artifice which Ellis
suggested as to the mode of his calls at Ty Glas.&nbsp; Nor was
he unaware of the probable, nay, the hoped-for termination of
these repeated days of happiness.&nbsp; He was quite conscious
that the father wished for nothing better than the marriage of
his daughter to the heir of Bodowen; and when Nest had hidden her
face in his neck, which was encircled by her clasping arms, and
murmured into his ear her acknowledgment of love, he felt only
too desirous of finding some one to love him for ever.&nbsp;
Though not highly principled, he would not have tried to obtain
Nest on other terms save those of marriage: he did so pine after
enduring love, and fancied he should have bound her heart for
evermore to his, when they had taken the solemn oaths of
matrimony.</p>
<p>There was no great difficulty attending a secret marriage at
such a place and at such a time.&nbsp; One gusty autumn day,
Ellis ferried them round Penthryn to Llandutrwyn, and there saw
his little Nest become future Lady of Bodowen.</p>
<p>How often do we see giddy, coquetting, restless girls become
sobered by marriage?&nbsp; A great object in life is decided; one
on which their thoughts have been running in all their vagaries,
and they seem to verify the beautiful fable of Undine.&nbsp; A
new soul beams out in the gentleness and repose of their future
lives.&nbsp; An indescribable softness and tenderness takes place
of the wearying vanity of their former endeavours to attract
admiration.&nbsp; Something of this sort took place in Nest
Pritchard.&nbsp; If at first she had been anxious to attract the
young Squire of Bodowen, long before her marriage this feeling
had merged into a truer love than she had ever felt before; and
now that he was her own, her husband, her whole soul was bent
toward making him amends, as far as in her lay, for the misery
which, with a woman&rsquo;s tact, she saw that he had to endure
at his home.&nbsp; Her greetings were abounding in
delicately-expressed love; her study of his tastes unwearying, in
the arrangement of her dress, her time, her very thoughts.</p>
<p>No wonder that he looked back on his wedding-day with a
thankfulness which is seldom the result of unequal
marriages.&nbsp; No wonder that his heart beat aloud as formerly
when he wound up the little path to Ty Glas, and saw&mdash;keen
though the winter&rsquo;s wind might be&mdash;that Nest was
standing out at the door to watch for his dimly-seen approach,
while the candle flared in the little window as a beacon to guide
him aright.</p>
<p>The angry words and unkind actions of home fell deadened on
his heart; he thought of the love that was surely his, and of the
new promise of love that a short time would bring forth, and he
could almost have smiled at the impotent efforts to disturb his
peace.</p>
<p>A few more months, and the young father was greeted by a
feeble little cry, when he hastily entered Ty Glas, one morning
early, in consequence of a summons conveyed mysteriously to
Bodowen; and the pale mother, smiling, and feebly holding up her
babe to its father&rsquo;s kiss, seemed to him even more lovely
than the bright gay Nest who had won his heart at the little inn
of Penmorfa.</p>
<p>But the curse was at work!&nbsp; The fulfilment of the
prophecy was nigh at hand!</p>
<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was the autumn after the birth
of their boy; it had been a glorious summer, with bright, hot,
sunny weather; and now the year was fading away as seasonably
into mellow days, with mornings of silver mists and clear frosty
nights.&nbsp; The blooming look of the time of flowers, was past
and gone; but instead there were even richer tints abroad in the
sun-coloured leaves, the lichens, the golden blossomed furze; if
it was the time of fading, there was a glory in the decay.</p>
<p>Nest, in her loving anxiety to surround her dwelling with
every charm for her husband&rsquo;s sake, had turned gardener,
and the little corners of the rude court before the house were
filled with many a delicate mountain-flower, transplanted more
for its beauty than its rarity.&nbsp; The sweetbrier bush may
even yet be seen, old and gray, which she and Owen planted a
green slipling beneath the window of her little chamber.&nbsp; In
those moments Owen forgot all besides the present; all the cares
and griefs he had known in the past, and all that might await him
of woe and death in the future.&nbsp; The boy, too, was as lovely
a child as the fondest parent was ever blessed with; and crowed
with delight, and clapped his little hands, as his mother held
him in her arms at the cottage-door to watch his father&rsquo;s
ascent up the rough path that led to Ty Glas, one bright autumnal
morning; and when the three entered the house together, it was
difficult to say which was the happiest.&nbsp; Owen carried his
boy, and tossed and played with him, while Nest sought out some
little article of work, and seated herself on the dresser beneath
the window, where now busily plying the needle, and then again
looking at her husband, she eagerly told him the little pieces of
domestic intelligence, the winning ways of the child, the result
of yesterday&rsquo;s fishing, and such of the gossip of Penmorfa
as came to the ears of the now retired Nest.&nbsp; She noticed
that, when she mentioned any little circumstance which bore the
slightest reference to Bodowen, her husband appeared chafed and
uneasy, and at last avoided anything that might in the least
remind him of home.&nbsp; In truth, he had been suffering much of
late from the irritability of his father, shown in trifles to be
sure, but not the less galling on that account.</p>
<p>While they were thus talking, and caressing each other and the
child, a shadow darkened the room, and before they could catch a
glimpse of the object that had occasioned it, it vanished, and
Squire Griffiths lifted the door-latch and stood before
them.&nbsp; He stood and looked&mdash;first on his son, so
different, in his buoyant expression of content and enjoyment,
with his noble child in his arms, like a proud and happy father,
as he was, from the depressed, moody young man he too often
appeared at Bodowen; then on Nest&mdash;poor, trembling, sickened
Nest!&mdash;who dropped her work, but yet durst not stir from her
seat, on the dresser, while she looked to her husband as if for
protection from his father.</p>
<p>The Squire was silent, as he glared from one to the other, his
features white with restrained passion.&nbsp; When he spoke, his
words came most distinct in their forced composure.&nbsp; It was
to his son he addressed himself:</p>
<p>&ldquo;That woman! who is she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Owen hesitated one moment, and then replied, in a steady, yet
quiet voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father, that woman is my wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He would have added some apology for the long concealment of
his marriage; have appealed to his father&rsquo;s forgiveness;
but the foam flew from Squire Owen&rsquo;s lips as he burst forth
with invective against Nest:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have married her!&nbsp; It is as they told
me!&nbsp; Married Nest Pritchard yr buten!&nbsp; And you stand
there as if you had not disgraced yourself for ever and ever with
your accursed wiving!&nbsp; And the fair harlot sits there, in
her mocking modesty, practising the mimming airs that will become
her state as future Lady of Bodowen.&nbsp; But I will move heaven
and earth before that false woman darken the doors of my
father&rsquo;s house as mistress!&rdquo;</p>
<p>All this was said with such rapidity that Owen had no time for
the words that thronged to his lips.&nbsp; &ldquo;Father!&rdquo;
(he burst forth at length) &ldquo;Father, whosoever told you that
Nest Pritchard was a harlot told you a lie as false as
hell!&nbsp; Ay! a lie as false as hell!&rdquo; he added, in a
voice of thunder, while he advanced a step or two nearer to the
Squire.&nbsp; And then, in a lower tone, he said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is as pure as your own wife; nay, God help me! as
the dear, precious mother who brought me forth, and then left
me&mdash;with no refuge in a mother&rsquo;s heart&mdash;to
struggle on through life alone.&nbsp; I tell you Nest is as pure
as that dear, dead mother!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fool&mdash;poor fool!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this moment the child&mdash;the little Owen&mdash;who had
kept gazing from one angry countenance to the other, and with
earnest look, trying to understand what had brought the fierce
glare into the face where till now he had read nothing but love,
in some way attracted the Squire&rsquo;s attention, and increased
his wrath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;poor, weak fool that
you are, hugging the child of another as if it were your own
offspring!&rdquo;&nbsp; Owen involuntarily caressed the
affrighted child, and half smiled at the implication of his
father&rsquo;s words.&nbsp; This the Squire perceived, and
raising his voice to a scream of rage, he went on:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I bid you, if you call yourself my son, to cast away
that miserable, shameless woman&rsquo;s offspring; cast it away
this instant&mdash;this instant!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In this ungovernable rage, seeing that Owen was far from
complying with his command, he snatched the poor infant from the
loving arms that held it, and throwing it to his mother, left the
house inarticulate with fury.</p>
<p>Nest&mdash;who had been pale and still as marble during this
terrible dialogue, looking on and listening as if fascinated by
the words that smote her heart&mdash;opened her arms to receive
and cherish her precious babe; but the boy was not destined to
reach the white refuge of her breast.&nbsp; The furious action of
the Squire had been almost without aim, and the infant fell
against the sharp edge of the dresser down on to the stone
floor.</p>
<p>Owen sprang up to take the child, but he lay so still, so
motionless, that the awe of death came over the father, and he
stooped down to gaze more closely.&nbsp; At that moment, the
upturned, filmy eyes rolled convulsively&mdash;a spasm passed
along the body&mdash;and the lips, yet warm with kissing,
quivered into everlasting rest.</p>
<p>A word from her husband told Nest all.&nbsp; She slid down
from her seat, and lay by her little son as corpse-like as he,
unheeding all the agonizing endearments and passionate
adjurations of her husband.&nbsp; And that poor, desolate husband
and father!&nbsp; Scarce one little quarter of an hour, and he
had been so blessed in his consciousness of love! the bright
promise of many years on his infant&rsquo;s face, and the new,
fresh soul beaming forth in its awakened intelligence.&nbsp; And
there it was; the little clay image, that would never more
gladden up at the sight of him, nor stretch forth to meet his
embrace; whose inarticulate, yet most eloquent cooings might
haunt him in his dreams, but would never more be heard in waking
life again!&nbsp; And by the dead babe, almost as utterly
insensate, the poor mother had fallen in a merciful
faint&mdash;the slandered, heart-pierced Nest!&nbsp; Owen
struggled against the sickness that came over him, and busied
himself in vain attempts at her restoration.</p>
<p>It was now near noon-day, and Ellis Pritchard came home,
little dreaming of the sight that awaited him; but though
stunned, he was able to take more effectual measures for his poor
daughter&rsquo;s recovery than Owen had done.</p>
<p>By-and-by she showed symptoms of returning sense, and was
placed in her own little bed in a darkened room, where, without
ever waking to complete consciousness, she fell asleep.&nbsp;
Then it was that her husband, suffocated by pressure of miserable
thought, gently drew his hand from her tightened clasp, and
printing one long soft kiss on her white waxen forehead, hastily
stole out of the room, and out of the house.</p>
<p>Near the base of Moel G&ecirc;st&mdash;it might be a quarter
of a mile from Ty Glas&mdash;was a little neglected solitary
copse, wild and tangled with the trailing branches of the
dog-rose and the tendrils of the white bryony.&nbsp; Toward the
middle of this thicket a deep crystal pool&mdash;a clear mirror
for the blue heavens above&mdash;and round the margin floated the
broad green leaves of the water-lily, and when the regal sun
shone down in his noonday glory the flowers arose from their cool
depths to welcome and greet him.&nbsp; The copse was musical with
many sounds; the warbling of birds rejoicing in its shades, the
ceaseless hum of the insects that hovered over the pool, the
chime of the distant waterfall, the occasional bleating of the
sheep from the mountaintop, were all blended into the delicious
harmony of nature.</p>
<p>It had been one of Owen&rsquo;s favourite resorts when he had
been a lonely wanderer&mdash;a pilgrim in search of love in the
years gone by.&nbsp; And thither he went, as if by instinct, when
he left Ty Glas; quelling the uprising agony till he should reach
that little solitary spot.</p>
<p>It was the time of day when a change in the aspect of the
weather so frequently takes place; and the little pool was no
longer the reflection of a blue and sunny sky: it sent back the
dark and slaty clouds above, and, every now and then, a rough
gust shook the painted autumn leaves from their branches, and all
other music was lost in the sound of the wild winds piping down
from the moorlands, which lay up and beyond the clefts in the
mountain-side.&nbsp; Presently the rain came on and beat down in
torrents.</p>
<p>But Owen heeded it not.&nbsp; He sat on the dank ground, his
face buried in his hands, and his whole strength, physical and
mental, employed in quelling the rush of blood, which rose and
boiled and gurgled in his brain as if it would madden him.</p>
<p>The phantom of his dead child rose ever before him, and seemed
to cry aloud for vengeance.&nbsp; And when the poor young man
thought upon the victim whom he required in his wild longing for
revenge, he shuddered, for it was his father!</p>
<p>Again and again he tried not to think; but still the circle of
thought came round, eddying through his brain.&nbsp; At length he
mastered his passions, and they were calm; then he forced himself
to arrange some plan for the future.</p>
<p>He had not, in the passionate hurry of the moment, seen that
his father had left the cottage before he was aware of the fatal
accident that befell the child.&nbsp; Owen thought he had seen
all; and once he planned to go to the Squire and tell him of the
anguish of heart he had wrought, and awe him, as it were, by the
dignity of grief.&nbsp; But then again he durst not&mdash;he
distrusted his self-control&mdash;the old prophecy rose up in its
horror&mdash;he dreaded his doom.</p>
<p>At last he determined to leave his father for ever; to take
Nest to some distant country where she might forget her
firstborn, and where he himself might gain a livelihood by his
own exertions.</p>
<p>But when he tried to descend to the various little
arrangements which were involved in the execution of this plan,
he remembered that all his money (and in this respect Squire
Griffiths was no niggard) was locked up in his escritoire at
Bodowen.&nbsp; In vain he tried to do away with this
matter-of-fact difficulty; go to Bodowen he must: and his only
hope&mdash;nay his determination&mdash;was to avoid his
father.</p>
<p>He rose and took a by-path to Bodowen.&nbsp; The house looked
even more gloomy and desolate than usual in the heavy
down-pouring rain, yet Owen gazed on it with something of
regret&mdash;for sorrowful as his days in it had been, he was
about to leave it for many many years, if not for ever.&nbsp; He
entered by a side door opening into a passage that led to his own
room, where he kept his books, his guns, his fishing-tackle, his
writing materials, et cetera.</p>
<p>Here he hurriedly began to select the few articles he intended
to take; for, besides the dread of interruption, he was
feverishly anxious to travel far that very night, if only Nest
was capable of performing the journey.&nbsp; As he was thus
employed, he tried to conjecture what his father&rsquo;s feelings
would be on finding that his once-loved son was gone away for
ever.&nbsp; Would he then awaken to regret for the conduct which
had driven him from home, and bitterly think on the loving and
caressing boy who haunted his footsteps in former days?&nbsp; Or,
alas! would he only feel that an obstacle to his daily
happiness&mdash;to his contentment with his wife, and his
strange, doting affection for the child&mdash;was taken
away?&nbsp; Would they make merry over the heir&rsquo;s
departure?&nbsp; Then he thought of Nest&mdash;the young
childless mother, whose heart had not yet realized her fulness of
desolation.&nbsp; Poor Nest! so loving as she was, so devoted to
her child&mdash;how should he console her?&nbsp; He pictured her
away in a strange land, pining for her native mountains, and
refusing to be comforted because her child was not.</p>
<p>Even this thought of the home-sickness that might possibly
beset Nest hardly made him hesitate in his determination; so
strongly had the idea taken possession of him that only by
putting miles and leagues between him and his father could he
avert the doom which seemed blending itself with the very
purposes of his life as long as he stayed in proximity with the
slayer of his child.</p>
<p>He had now nearly completed his hasty work of preparation, and
was full of tender thoughts of his wife, when the door opened,
and the elfish Robert peered in, in search of some of his
brother&rsquo;s possessions.&nbsp; On seeing Owen he hesitated,
but then came boldly forward, and laid his hand on Owen&rsquo;s
arm, saying,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nesta yr buten!&nbsp; How is Nest yr buten?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked maliciously into Owen&rsquo;s face to mark the
effect of his words, but was terrified at the expression he read
there.&nbsp; He started off and ran to the door, while Owen tried
to check himself, saying continually, &ldquo;He is but a
child.&nbsp; He does not understand the meaning of what he
says.&nbsp; He is but a child!&rdquo;&nbsp; Still Robert, now in
fancied security, kept calling out his insulting words, and
Owen&rsquo;s hand was on his gun, grasping it as if to restrain
his rising fury.</p>
<p>But when Robert passed on daringly to mocking words relating
to the poor dead child, Owen could bear it no longer; and before
the boy was well aware, Owen was fiercely holding him in an iron
clasp with one hand, while he struck him hard with the other.</p>
<p>In a minute he checked himself.&nbsp; He paused, relaxed his
grasp, and, to his horror, he saw Robert sink to the ground; in
fact, the lad was half-stunned, half-frightened, and thought it
best to assume insensibility.</p>
<p>Owen&mdash;miserable Owen&mdash;seeing him lie there
prostrate, was bitterly repentant, and would have dragged him to
the carved settle, and done all he could to restore him to his
senses, but at this instant the Squire came in.</p>
<p>Probably, when the household at Bodowen rose that morning,
there was but one among them ignorant of the heir&rsquo;s
relation to Nest Pritchard and her child; for secret as he tried
to make his visits to Ty Glas, they had been too frequent not to
be noticed, and Nest&rsquo;s altered conduct&mdash;no longer
frequenting dances and merry-makings&mdash;was a strongly
corroborative circumstance.&nbsp; But Mrs. Griffiths&rsquo;
influence reigned paramount, if unacknowledged, at Bodowen, and
till she sanctioned the disclosure, none would dare to tell the
Squire.</p>
<p>Now, however, the time drew near when it suited her to make
her husband aware of the connection his son had formed; so, with
many tears, and much seeming reluctance, she broke the
intelligence to him&mdash;taking good care, at the same time, to
inform him of the light character Nest had borne.&nbsp; Nor did
she confine this evil reputation to her conduct before her
marriage, but insinuated that even to this day she was a
&ldquo;woman of the grove and brake&rdquo;&mdash;for centuries
the Welsh term of opprobrium for the loosest female
characters.</p>
<p>Squire Griffiths easily tracked Owen to Ty Glas; and without
any aim but the gratification of his furious anger, followed him
to upbraid as we have seen.&nbsp; But he left the cottage even
more enraged against his son than he had entered it, and returned
home to hear the evil suggestions of the stepmother.&nbsp; He had
heard a slight scuffle in which he caught the tones of
Robert&rsquo;s voice, as he passed along the hall, and an instant
afterwards he saw the apparently lifeless body of his little
favourite dragged along by the culprit Owen&mdash;the marks of
strong passion yet visible on his face.&nbsp; Not loud, but
bitter and deep were the evil words which the father bestowed on
the son; and as Owen stood proudly and sullenly silent,
disdaining all exculpation of himself in the presence of one who
had wrought him so much graver&mdash;so fatal an
injury&mdash;Robert&rsquo;s mother entered the room.&nbsp; At
sight of her natural emotion the wrath of the Squire was
redoubled, and his wild suspicions that this violence of
Owen&rsquo;s to Robert was a premeditated act appeared like the
proven truth through the mists of rage.&nbsp; He summoned
domestics as if to guard his own and his wife&rsquo;s life from
the attempts of his son; and the servants stood wondering
around&mdash;now gazing at Mrs. Griffiths, alternately scolding
and sobbing, while she tried to restore the lad from his really
bruised and half-unconscious state; now at the fierce and angry
Squire; and now at the sad and silent Owen.&nbsp; And he&mdash;he
was hardly aware of their looks of wonder and terror; his
father&rsquo;s words fell on a deadened ear; for before his eyes
there rose a pale dead babe, and in that lady&rsquo;s violent
sounds of grief he heard the wailing of a more sad, more hopeless
mother.&nbsp; For by this time the lad Robert had opened his
eyes, and though evidently suffering a good deal from the effects
of Owen&rsquo;s blows, was fully conscious of all that was
passing around him.</p>
<p>Had Owen been left to his own nature, his heart would have
worked itself to doubly love the boy whom he had injured; but he
was stubborn from injustice, and hardened by suffering.&nbsp; He
refused to vindicate himself; he made no effort to resist the
imprisonment the Squire had decreed, until a surgeon&rsquo;s
opinion of the real extent of Robert&rsquo;s injuries was made
known.&nbsp; It was not until the door was locked and barred, as
if upon some wild and furious beast, that the recollection of
poor Nest, without his comforting presence, came into his
mind.&nbsp; Oh! thought he, how she would be wearying, pining for
his tender sympathy; if, indeed, she had recovered the shock of
mind sufficiently to be sensible of consolation!&nbsp; What would
she think of his absence?&nbsp; Could she imagine he believed his
father&rsquo;s words, and had left her, in this her sore trouble
and bereavement?&nbsp; The thought madened him, and he looked
around for some mode of escape.</p>
<p>He had been confined in a small unfurnished room on the first
floor, wainscoted, and carved all round, with a massy door,
calculated to resist the attempts of a dozen strong men, even had
he afterward been able to escape from the house unseen,
unheard.&nbsp; The window was placed (as is common in old Welsh
houses) over the fire-place; with branching chimneys on either
hand, forming a sort of projection on the outside.&nbsp; By this
outlet his escape was easy, even had he been less determined and
desperate than he was.&nbsp; And when he had descended, with a
little care, a little winding, he might elude all observation and
pursue his original intention of going to Ty Glas.</p>
<p>The storm had abated, and watery sunbeams were gilding the
bay, as Owen descended from the window, and, stealing along in
the broad afternoon shadows, made his way to the little plateau
of green turf in the garden at the top of a steep precipitous
rock, down the abrupt face of which he had often dropped, by
means of a well-secured rope, into the small sailing-boat (his
father&rsquo;s present, alas! in days gone by) which lay moored
in the deep sea-water below.&nbsp; He had always kept his boat
there, because it was the nearest available spot to the house;
but before he could reach the place&mdash;unless, indeed, he
crossed a broad sun-lighted piece of ground in full view of the
windows on that side of the house, and without the shadow of a
single sheltering tree or shrub&mdash;he had to skirt round a
rude semicircle of underwood, which would have been considered as
a shrubbery had any one taken pains with it.&nbsp; Step by step
he stealthily moved along&mdash;hearing voices now, again seeing
his father and stepmother in no distant walk, the Squire
evidently caressing and consoling his wife, who seemed to be
urging some point with great vehemence, again forced to crouch
down to avoid being seen by the cook, returning from the rude
kitchen-garden with a handful of herbs.&nbsp; This was the way
the doomed heir of Bodowen left his ancestral house for ever, and
hoped to leave behind him his doom.&nbsp; At length he reached
the plateau&mdash;he breathed more freely.&nbsp; He stooped to
discover the hidden coil of rope, kept safe and dry in a hole
under a great round flat piece of rock: his head was bent down;
he did not see his father approach, nor did he hear his footstep
for the rush of blood to his head in the stooping effort of
lifting the stone; the Squire had grappled with him before he
rose up again, before he fully knew whose hands detained him,
now, when his liberty of person and action seemed secure.&nbsp;
He made a vigorous struggle to free himself; he wrestled with his
father for a moment&mdash;he pushed him hard, and drove him on to
the great displaced stone, all unsteady in its balance.</p>
<p>Down went the Squire, down into the deep waters
below&mdash;down after him went Owen, half consciously, half
unconsciously, partly compelled by the sudden cessation of any
opposing body, partly from a vehement irrepressible impulse to
rescue his father.&nbsp; But he had instinctively chosen a safer
place in the deep seawater pool than that into which his push had
sent his father.&nbsp; The Squire had hit his head with much
violence against the side of the boat, in his fall; it is,
indeed, doubtful whether he was not killed before ever he sank
into the sea.&nbsp; But Owen knew nothing save that the awful
doom seemed even now present.&nbsp; He plunged down, he dived
below the water in search of the body which had none of the
elasticity of life to buoy it up; he saw his father in those
depths, he clutched at him, he brought him up and cast him, a
dead weight, into the boat, and exhausted by the effort, he had
begun himself to sink again before he instinctively strove to
rise and climb into the rocking boat.&nbsp; There lay his father,
with a deep dent in the side of his head where the skull had been
fractured by his fall; his face blackened by the arrested course
of the blood.&nbsp; Owen felt his pulse, his heart&mdash;all was
still.&nbsp; He called him by his name.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father, father!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;come back! come
back!&nbsp; You never knew how I loved you! how I could love you
still&mdash;if&mdash;Oh God!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the thought of his little child rose before him.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yes, father,&rdquo; he cried afresh, &ldquo;you never knew
how he fell&mdash;how he died!&nbsp; Oh, if I had but had
patience to tell you!&nbsp; If you would but have borne with me
and listened!&nbsp; And now it is over!&nbsp; Oh father!
father!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whether she had heard this wild wailing voice, or whether it
was only that she missed her husband and wanted him for some
little every-day question, or, as was perhaps more likely, she
had discovered Owen&rsquo;s escape, and come to inform her
husband of it, I do not know, but on the rock, right above his
head, as it seemed, Owen heard his stepmother calling her
husband.</p>
<p>He was silent, and softly pushed the boat right under the rock
till the sides grated against the stones, and the overhanging
branches concealed him and it from all not on a level with the
water.&nbsp; Wet as he was, he lay down by his dead father the
better to conceal himself; and, somehow, the action recalled
those early days of childhood&mdash;the first in the
Squire&rsquo;s widowhood&mdash;when Owen had shared his
father&rsquo;s bed, and used to waken him in the morning to hear
one of the old Welsh legends.&nbsp; How long he lay
thus&mdash;body chilled, and brain hard-working through the heavy
pressure of a reality as terrible as a nightmare&mdash;he never
knew; but at length he roused himself up to think of Nest.</p>
<p>Drawing out a great sail, he covered up the body of his father
with it where he lay in the bottom of the boat.&nbsp; Then with
his numbed hands he took the oars, and pulled out into the more
open sea toward Criccaeth.&nbsp; He skirted along the coast till
he found a shadowed cleft in the dark rocks; to that point he
rowed, and anchored his boat close in land.&nbsp; Then he
mounted, staggering, half longing to fall into the dark waters
and be at rest&mdash;half instinctively finding out the surest
foot-rests on that precipitous face of rock, till he was high up,
safe landed on the turfy summit.&nbsp; He ran off, as if pursued,
toward Penmorfa; he ran with maddened energy.&nbsp; Suddenly he
paused, turned, ran again with the same speed, and threw himself
prone on the summit, looking down into his boat with straining
eyes to see if there had been any movement of life&mdash;any
displacement of a fold of sail-cloth.&nbsp; It was all quiet deep
down below, but as he gazed the shifting light gave the
appearance of a slight movement.&nbsp; Owen ran to a lower part
of the rock, stripped, plunged into the water, and swam to the
boat.&nbsp; When there, all was still&mdash;awfully still!&nbsp;
For a minute or two, he dared not lift up the cloth.&nbsp; Then
reflecting that the same terror might beset him again&mdash;of
leaving his father unaided while yet a spark of life
lingered&mdash;he removed the shrouding cover.&nbsp; The eyes
looked into his with a dead stare!&nbsp; He closed the lids and
bound up the jaw.&nbsp; Again he looked.&nbsp; This time he
raised himself out of the water and kissed the brow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was my doom, father!&nbsp; It would have been better
if I had died at my birth!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Daylight was fading away.&nbsp; Precious daylight!&nbsp; He
swam back, dressed, and set off afresh for Penmorfa.&nbsp; When
he opened the door of Ty Glas, Ellis Pritchard looked at him
reproachfully, from his seat in the darkly-shadowed
chimney-corner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re come at last,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp;
&ldquo;One of our kind (<i>i.e.</i>, station) would not have left
his wife to mourn by herself over her dead child; nor would one
of our kind have let his father kill his own true son.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve a good mind to take her from you for ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not tell him,&rdquo; cried Nest, looking
piteously at her husband; &ldquo;he made me tell him part, and
guessed the rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was nursing her babe on her knee as if it was alive.&nbsp;
Owen stood before Ellis Pritchard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be silent,&rdquo; said he, quietly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Neither words nor deeds but what are decreed can come to
pass.&nbsp; I was set to do my work, this hundred years and
more.&nbsp; The time waited for me, and the man waited for
me.&nbsp; I have done what was foretold of me for
generations!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ellis Pritchard knew the old tale of the prophecy, and
believed in it in a dull, dead kind of way, but somehow never
thought it would come to pass in his time.&nbsp; Now, however, he
understood it all in a moment, though he mistook Owen&rsquo;s
nature so much as to believe that the deed was intentionally
done, out of revenge for the death of his boy; and viewing it in
this light, Ellis thought it little more than a just punishment
for the cause of all the wild despairing sorrow he had seen his
only child suffer during the hours of this long afternoon.&nbsp;
But he knew the law would not so regard it.&nbsp; Even the lax
Welsh law of those days could not fail to examine into the death
of a man of Squire Griffith&rsquo;s standing.&nbsp; So the acute
Ellis thought how he could conceal the culprit for a time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t look so
scared!&nbsp; It was your doom, not your fault;&rdquo; and he
laid a hand on Owen&rsquo;s shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re wet,&rdquo; said he, suddenly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Where have you been?&nbsp; Nest, your husband is dripping,
drookit wet.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what makes him look so blue and
wan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nest softly laid her baby in its cradle; she was half
stupefied with crying, and had not understood to what Owen
alluded, when he spoke of his doom being fulfilled, if indeed she
had heard the words.</p>
<p>Her touch thawed Owen&rsquo;s miserable heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Nest!&rdquo; said he, clasping her in his arms;
&ldquo;do you love me still&mdash;can you love me, my own
darling?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; asked she, her eyes filling with
tears.&nbsp; &ldquo;I only love you more than ever, for you were
my poor baby&rsquo;s father!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Nest&mdash;Oh, tell her, Ellis! <i>you</i>
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No need, no need!&rdquo; said Ellis.&nbsp;
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s had enough to think on.&nbsp; Bustle, my girl,
and get out my Sunday clothes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; said Nest, putting her
hand up to her head.&nbsp; &ldquo;What is to tell? and why are
you so wet?&nbsp; God help me for a poor crazed thing, for I
cannot guess at the meaning of your words and your strange
looks!&nbsp; I only know my baby is dead!&rdquo; and she burst
into tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, Nest! go and fetch him a change, quick!&rdquo;
and as she meekly obeyed, too languid to strive further to
understand, Ellis said rapidly to Owen, in a low, hurried
voice&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you meaning that the Squire is dead?&nbsp; Speak
low, lest she hear.&nbsp; Well, well, no need to talk about how
he died.&nbsp; It was sudden, I see; and we must all of us die;
and he&rsquo;ll have to be buried.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s well the
night is near.&nbsp; And I should not wonder now if you&rsquo;d
like to travel for a bit; it would do Nest a power of good; and
then&mdash;there&rsquo;s many a one goes out of his own house and
never comes back again; and&mdash;I trust he&rsquo;s not lying in
his own house&mdash;and there&rsquo;s a stir for a bit, and a
search, and a wonder&mdash;and, by-and-by, the heir just steps
in, as quiet as can be.&nbsp; And that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;ll
do, and bring Nest to Bodowen after all.&nbsp; Nay, child, better
stockings nor those; find the blue woollens I bought at Llanrwst
fair.&nbsp; Only don&rsquo;t lose heart.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s done
now and can&rsquo;t be helped.&nbsp; It was the piece of work set
you to do from the days of the Tudors, they say.&nbsp; And he
deserved it.&nbsp; Look in yon cradle.&nbsp; So tell us where he
is, and I&rsquo;ll take heart of grace and see what can be done
for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Owen sat wet and haggard, looking into the peat fire as if
for visions of the past, and never heeding a word Ellis
said.&nbsp; Nor did he move when Nest brought the armful of dry
clothes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, rouse up, man!&rdquo; said Ellis, growing
impatient.&nbsp; But he neither spoke nor moved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the matter, father?&rdquo; asked Nest,
bewildered.</p>
<p>Ellis kept on watching Owen for a minute or two, till on his
daughter&rsquo;s repetition of the question, he said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ask him yourself, Nest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, husband, what is it?&rdquo; said she, kneeling down
and bringing her face to a level with his.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know?&rdquo; said he, heavily.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t love me when you do know.&nbsp; And yet it
was not my doing: it was my doom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does he mean, father?&rdquo; asked Nest, looking
up; but she caught a gesture from Ellis urging her to go on
questioning her husband.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will love you, husband, whatever has happened.&nbsp;
Only let me know the worst.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A pause, during which Nest and Ellis hung breathless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father is dead, Nest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nest caught her breath with a sharp gasp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God forgive him!&rdquo; said she, thinking on her
babe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God forgive <i>me</i>!&rdquo; said Owen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did not&mdash;&rdquo; Nest stopped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I did.&nbsp; Now you know it.&nbsp; It was my
doom.&nbsp; How could I help it?&nbsp; The devil helped
me&mdash;he placed the stone so that my father fell.&nbsp; I
jumped into the water to save him.&nbsp; I did, indeed,
Nest.&nbsp; I was nearly drowned myself.&nbsp; But he was
dead&mdash;dead&mdash;killed by the fall!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then he is safe at the bottom of the sea?&rdquo; said
Ellis, with hungry eagerness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he is not; he lies in my boat,&rdquo; said Owen,
shivering a little, more at the thought of his last glimpse at
his father&rsquo;s face than from cold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, husband, change your wet clothes!&rdquo; pleaded
Nest, to whom the death of the old man was simply a horror with
which she had nothing to do, while her husband&rsquo;s discomfort
was a present trouble.</p>
<p>While she helped him to take off the wet garments which he
would never have had energy enough to remove of himself, Ellis
was busy preparing food, and mixing a great tumbler of spirits
and hot water.&nbsp; He stood over the unfortunate young man and
compelled him to eat and drink, and made Nest, too, taste some
mouthfuls&mdash;all the while planning in his own mind how best
to conceal what had been done, and who had done it; not
altogether without a certain feeling of vulgar triumph in the
reflection that Nest, as she stood there, carelessly dressed,
dishevelled in her grief, was in reality the mistress of Bodowen,
than which Ellis Pritchard had never seen a grander house, though
he believed such might exist.</p>
<p>By dint of a few dexterous questions he found out all he
wanted to know from Owen, as he ate and drank.&nbsp; In fact, it
was almost a relief to Owen to dilute the horror by talking about
it.&nbsp; Before the meal was done, if meal it could be called,
Ellis knew all he cared to know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Nest, on with your cloak and haps.&nbsp; Pack up
what needs to go with you, for both you and your husband must be
half way to Liverpool by to-morrow&rsquo;s morn.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll
take you past Rhyl Sands in my fishing-boat, with yours in tow;
and, once over the dangerous part, I&rsquo;ll return with my
cargo of fish, and learn how much stir there is at Bodowen.&nbsp;
Once safe hidden in Liverpool, no one will know where you are,
and you may stay quiet till your time comes for
returning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will never come home again,&rdquo; said Owen,
doggedly.&nbsp; &ldquo;The place is accursed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hoot! be guided by me, man.&nbsp; Why, it was but an
accident, after all!&nbsp; And we&rsquo;ll land at the Holy
Island, at the Point of Llyn; there is an old cousin of mine, the
parson, there&mdash;for the Pritchards have known better days,
Squire&mdash;and we&rsquo;ll bury him there.&nbsp; It was but an
accident, man.&nbsp; Hold up your head!&nbsp; You and Nest will
come home yet and fill Bodowen with children, and I&rsquo;ll live
to see it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never!&rdquo; said Owen.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am the last
male of my race, and the son has murdered his father!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nest came in laden and cloaked.&nbsp; Ellis was for hurrying
them off.&nbsp; The fire was extinguished, the door was
locked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, Nest, my darling, let me take your bundle while I
guide you down the steps.&rdquo;&nbsp; But her husband bent his
head, and spoke never a word.&nbsp; Nest gave her father the
bundle (already loaded with such things as he himself had seen
fit to take), but clasped another softly and tightly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one shall help me with this,&rdquo; said she, in a
low voice.</p>
<p>Her father did not understand her; her husband did, and placed
his strong helping arm round her waist, and blessed her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will all go together, Nest,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But where?&rdquo; and he looked up at the storm-tossed
clouds coming up from windward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a dirty night,&rdquo; said Ellis, turning his
head round to speak to his companions at last.&nbsp; &ldquo;But
never fear, we&rsquo;ll weather it?&rdquo;&nbsp; And he made for
the place where his vessel was moored.&nbsp; Then he stopped and
thought a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stay here!&rdquo; said he, addressing his
companions.&nbsp; &ldquo;I may meet folk, and I shall, maybe,
have to hear and to speak.&nbsp; You wait here till I come back
for you.&rdquo;&nbsp; So they sat down close together in a corner
of the path.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me look at him, Nest!&rdquo; said Owen.</p>
<p>She took her little dead son out from under her shawl; they
looked at his waxen face long and tenderly; kissed it, and
covered it up reverently and softly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nest,&rdquo; said Owen, at last, &ldquo;I feel as
though my father&rsquo;s spirit had been near us, and as if it
had bent over our poor little one.&nbsp; A strange chilly air met
me as I stooped over him.&nbsp; I could fancy the spirit of our
pure, blameless child guiding my father&rsquo;s safe over the
paths of the sky to the gates of heaven, and escaping those
accursed dogs of hell that were darting up from the north in
pursuit of souls not five minutes since.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk so, Owen,&rdquo; said Nest, curling up
to him in the darkness of the copse.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who knows what
may be listening?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The pair were silent, in a kind of nameless terror, till they
heard Ellis Pritchard&rsquo;s loud whisper.&nbsp; &ldquo;Where
are ye?&nbsp; Come along, soft and steady.&nbsp; There were folk
about even now, and the Squire is missed, and madam in a
fright.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They went swiftly down to the little harbour, and embarked on
board Ellis&rsquo;s boat.&nbsp; The sea heaved and rocked even
there; the torn clouds went hurrying overhead in a wild
tumultuous manner.</p>
<p>They put out into the bay; still in silence, except when some
word of command was spoken by Ellis, who took the management of
the vessel.&nbsp; They made for the rocky shore, where
Owen&rsquo;s boat had been moored.&nbsp; It was not there.&nbsp;
It had broken loose and disappeared.</p>
<p>Owen sat down and covered his face.&nbsp; This last event, so
simple and natural in itself, struck on his excited and
superstitious mind in an extraordinary manner.&nbsp; He had hoped
for a certain reconciliation, so to say, by laying his father and
his child both in one grave.&nbsp; But now it appeared to him as
if there was to be no forgiveness; as if his father revolted even
in death against any such peaceful union.&nbsp; Ellis took a
practical view of the case.&nbsp; If the Squire&rsquo;s body was
found drifting about in a boat known to belong to his son, it
would create terrible suspicion as to the manner of his
death.&nbsp; At one time in the evening, Ellis had thought of
persuading Owen to let him bury the Squire in a sailor&rsquo;s
grave; or, in other words, to sew him up in a spare sail, and
weighting it well, sink it for ever.&nbsp; He had not broached
the subject, from a certain fear of Owen&rsquo;s passionate
repugnance to the plan; otherwise, if he had consented, they
might have returned to Penmorfa, and passively awaited the course
of events, secure of Owen&rsquo;s succession to Bodowen, sooner
or later; or if Owen was too much overwhelmed by what had
happened, Ellis would have advised him to go away for a short
time, and return when the buzz and the talk was over.</p>
<p>Now it was different.&nbsp; It was absolutely necessary that
they should leave the country for a time.&nbsp; Through those
stormy waters they must plough their way that very night.&nbsp;
Ellis had no fear&mdash;would have had no fear, at any rate, with
Owen as he had been a week, a day ago; but with Owen wild,
despairing, helpless, fate-pursued, what could he do?</p>
<p>They sailed into the tossing darkness, and were never more
seen of men.</p>
<p>The house of Bodowen has sunk into damp, dark ruins; and a
Saxon stranger holds the lands of the Griffiths.</p>

law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can

written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium

with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
